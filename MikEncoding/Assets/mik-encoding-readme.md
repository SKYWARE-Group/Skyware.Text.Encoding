### MIK

MIK (МИК) is an 8-bit Cyrillic code page used with DOS and hardware devices. 
It is based on the character set used in the Pravetz computers (8x series, 16x series, etc.). 
Kermit calls this character set "BULGARIA-PC" / "bulgaria-pc".
This code page is known by FreeDOS as Code page 3021.

Even thogh the standard is old, it is still in use, including in hardware devices, such as cash registers, label printers, etc.
