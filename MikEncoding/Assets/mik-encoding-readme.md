## MIK Encoding

MIK (МИК) is an 8-bit Cyrillic code page used with DOS. 
It is based on the character set used in the Bulgarian Pravetz 16 IBM PC compatible systems. 
Kermit calls this character set "BULGARIA-PC" / "bulgaria-pc".
This code page is known by FreeDOS as Code page 3021.

Even the standard is old, it is still in use, including in hardware products.

**Note** Characters with code 192-255 are not yet implemented
